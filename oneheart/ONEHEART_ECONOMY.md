# ONEHEART ECONOMY

This document captures the high-level economic design for OneHeart: currencies, marketplace, and funding engine.

## Currency System

- Heart Tokens
  - User-earned token for performing verified real-world actions and contributions.
  - Primary spendable unit in the Reward Marketplace.
  - Issuance: awarded by Impact Engine after verification; can be burned for rewards or staked for access to higher-tier opportunities.

- Impact Credits
  - Internal accounting unit used for measuring value created by activities (not directly spendable publicly).
  - Used to compute rewards, leaderboards, and sponsor allocation signals.

- Sponsor Pool
  - Pooled funds from corporate / NGO sponsors used to top-up rewards, subsidize experiences, and seed local development funds.

## Reward Marketplace

- Travel Gear
  - Practical items (backpacks, gear, passes) redeemable with Heart Tokens.

- Tickets & Experiences
  - Local & regional experiences (workshops, transportation vouchers, event tickets) provided via partner integrations.

- Education & Upskills
  - Voucher-based courses, certification subsidies, micro-trainings redeemable with Heart Tokens or combined sponsor/participant payments.

Marketplace mechanics (suggested):
- Prices set in Heart Tokens; sponsors can subsidize categories.
- Fulfillment via partner APIs or manual coordination for pilots.

## Funding Engine

Structure:

- Local Development Fund
  - Controlled at community or regional node level for hyperlocal grants and micro-subsidies.

  - National Ascension Fund
    - Aggregates local successes; funds national-scale initiatives, scholarships, and cross-region programs.

    - Worldwalker Fund
      - Global reserve seeded by major sponsors and revenue share; supports international mobility programs and large grants.

Governance & flows (pilot suggestions):
- Sponsor contributions flow into Sponsor Pool; periodic allocations to Local / National / Worldwalker based on KPIs.
- Allocation rules: small % for operations, % for immediate rewards, % for funds (local/national/global) according to pre-agreed KPIs.

## Next Steps (practical for pilot)

1. Translate this structure into a one-page sponsor pitch and simple flowchart.
2. Create a spreadsheet model simulating token issuance, sponsor inflows and marketplace redemptions for a 4-week pilot.
3. Define 3 pilot rewards (one per marketplace category) and partner fulfillment paths.
