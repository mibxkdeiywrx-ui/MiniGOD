# WORLDWALKER ENGINE

Overview and practical plan for the Worldwalker program: preparation, domestic trial, global operations, and return-phase knowledge transfer.

## Preparation Phase

- Skill Grinding
  - Focus: practical technical and interpersonal skills (first aid, logistics, local language basics, digital skills).
  - Deliverables: modular micro-courses, short practical challenges, and verified skill badges.

- Language Upgrade
  - Focus: conversational phrases, mission-specific vocabulary, and translation tool training.
  - Deliverables: language packs, buddy practice sessions, and quick reference guides.

- Survival Readiness
  - Focus: safety briefings, local laws, emergency contacts, health checks and equipment checklists.
  - Deliverables: survival checklists, insurance & consent templates, safety SOPs.

## Domestic Trial

- Mini-Expedition
  - Small, managed trips to nearby communities to practice logistics, verification, and fulfillment.
  - Metrics: completion rate, verification accuracy, participant well-being scores.

- Real Impact Test
  - Assign real tasks with measurable community outcomes (e.g., repair, training, micro-construction).
  - Partner validation: local NGOs or community nodes sign-off required.

## Global Operation

- R&D Missions Abroad
  - Collaborative projects with local researchers or NGOs to test innovations and share learnings.

- Cultural Exchange
  - Short exchange programs to build mutual understanding and joint missions.

- Sports Development
  - Programs focused on sports training missions that scale community engagement and skills transfer.

- World Impact Actions
  - Large coordinated actions (e.g., cross-border environmental campaigns, health drives) with global sponsors.

## Return Phase

- Knowledge Transfer
  - Structured debriefs, documentation, and mentorship handoffs to local implementers.

  - Local Implementation
    - Pilot locally adapted projects based on field learnings and measure local outcomes.

    - Next-Gen Training
      - Train new cohorts with refined curricula and maintain an alumni mentorship network.

## Operational Notes

- Partnering: secure local partners early for validation, safety, and fulfillment.
- Funding: use Local Development Fund and National/Worldwalker allocations for travel grants and project subsidies.
- Measurement: standardize outcome metrics (beneficiaries, hours, cost per impact, verification rate).

## Pilot steps (practical)

1. Create a 6-week Preparation curriculum: 3 weeks online micro-courses + 3 days in-person practical workshop.  
2. Run a Domestic Trial with 8–12 participants, 2 local partner nodes and 4 mission types.  
3. Collect structured feedback and success metrics; refine training and safety SOPs.  
4. Prepare a funded Global Operation pilot scoped to one neighboring country with clear partner MOUs.

## Next actions (pick one)

- (1) Draft the 6-week Preparation curriculum outline (modules, time estimates, assessment rubrics).  
- (2) Produce participant onboarding templates: consent forms, travel checklists, insurance checklist and partner MOU template.  
- (3) Build a CSV seed list of 10 candidate partner nodes for Domestic Trial (name, contact, capacity, suggested mission types).

Tell me which (1/2/3) — I will implement and add the chosen outputs to the repository.
